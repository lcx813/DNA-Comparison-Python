# DNA-Comparison-Python
The project have methods for each of the following:

- Given a file, read in the DNA for each suspect and save it as a string
- Take a DNA string and split it into a list of codons
- Iterate through a suspect's codon list to see how many of their codons match the sample codons
- Pick the right suspect to continue the investigation on
